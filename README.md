# cfg-factbase-analyses

This github repository contains all the open source factbases and scripts/queries that were performed in Fa Fa's thesis. This repository is divided into multiple folders:

- `add-comp-script`: This folder contains the bash scripts used to add component names to entries in a node file and it also has the script used to split non-ROS-based facts into corresponding component-based node and edge files
- `cypher-files`: The cypher queries of different analyses performed for the thesis
- `factbase`: The factbases extracted from open source ROS-based systems
- `python-scripts`: The Python scripts used for running ROS-based queries and recording the respective outputs
- `python-script-revised`: TBD
- `setup-scripts`: The scripts used to setup local environment for running the experiment for each factbase
